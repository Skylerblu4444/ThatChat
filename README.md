# ThatChat
I made this with Bootstrap as a project, called ThatChat

Overview

ThatChat is a sleek, responsive web-based chat application prototype built with Bootstrap 5. 
This project showcases a modern UI for a secure messaging platform, featuring login and registration forms, a home page with feature highlights and a chat preview, an about page with team details, and a contact page with a form.
Created by me Skyler, ThatChat emphasizes privacy, ease of use, and responsive design, leveraging Bootstrap’s components and custom CSS for a polished experience.
